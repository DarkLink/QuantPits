An advanced, production-ready quantitative trading system built on top of [Microsoft Qlib](https://github.com/microsoft/qlib). This system provides a complete end-to-end pipeline for weekly and daily frequency trading, featuring modular architecture, multi-instance isolation (Workspaces), ensemble modeling, execution analytics, and interactive dashboards.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-Workspace Isolation**: Spin up independent "Pits" for different markets (e.g., CSI300, CSI500) or configurations without duplicating code.
* **Component-Based Pipeline**: 
  - **Train & Predict**: Support for both full and incremental training on multiple models (LSTM, GRU, Transformers, LightGBM, GATs).
  - **Brute Force & Ensemble**: High-performance (CuPy accelerated) brute force combination finding and intelligent signal fusion.
  - **Orders & Execution**: Generate actionable buy/sell signals with TopK/DropN logic and analyze micro-friction (slippage, delay costs).
* **Rich Observability**: Two interactive `streamlit` dashboards for macro portfolio performance and micro rolling health monitoring.
* **Resilient Infrastructure**: Automatic checkpoints, JSON tracking for model registries, and daily/weekly logs.

## 📂 Architecture Overview

The system strictly decouples the **Engine (Code)** from the **Workspace (Config & Data)**:

```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### 1. Requirements

Ensure you have a working installation of **Qlib**. The engine officially supports Python 3.8 to 3.12. Then install the extra dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# (Optional) Install the engine as a package for global access:
pip install -e .
```

*(Note: For GPU-accelerated brute force combinatorial backtesting, install `cupy-cuda11x` or `cupy-cuda12x` depending on your local CUDA version)*

### 2. Prepare Market Data

Before running the engine, ensure you have the required Qlib dataset downloaded to your local machine (e.g., `~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data`):

```bash
# Example: Download 1D data for the Chinese market
python -m qlib.run.get_data qlib_data --target_dir ~/.qlib/qlib_data/cn_data --region cn --version v2
```

> **Note:** This dataset contains massive historical market data. The initial download may require tens of GBs of disk space and a considerable amount of time. Please be patient.
```
Make sure `workspaces/Demo_Workspace/run_env.sh` or your Qlib initialization points to this directory.

### 3. Activate a Workspace

Every action must be performed within the context of an active workspace. We provide a `Demo_Workspace` to get you started:

```bash
cd QuantPits/
source workspaces/Demo_Workspace/run_env.sh
```

### 4. Run the Pipeline

Once activated, you can execute the minimal routine loop using the quantpits scripts (or you can simply run `make run-daily-pipeline` from the repository root):

```bash
# 0. Update Daily Market Data
# Note: This engine assumes underlying Qlib data has been updated (e.g., via external Cron). 
# If not, update it first.

# 1. Generate predictions from existing models
python -m quantpits.scripts.prod_predict_only --all-enabled

# 2. Fuse predictions using your combo configs
python -m quantpits.scripts.ensemble_fusion --from-config-all

# 3. Process previous week's live trades (Post-Trade)
python -m quantpits.scripts.prod_post_trade

# 4. Generate new Buy/Sell orders based on current holdings
python -m quantpits.scripts.order_gen
```

### 5. Launch Dashboards

To view the interactive analytics of your active workspace:

```bash
# Portfolio Execution and Holding Dashboard
streamlit run ui/dashboard.py

# Rolling Strategy Health & Factor Drift Dashboard
streamlit run ui/rolling_dashboard.py
```

## 🏗️ Creating a New Workspace

To spin up a new strategy for a different index (e.g., CSI 500), use the scaffolding utility:

```bash
python -m quantpits.scripts.init_workspace \
  --source workspaces/Demo_Workspace \
  --target workspaces/CSI500_Base
```

This will cleanly clone the configuration files and generate empty `data/`, `output/`, and `mlruns/` directories, completely isolated from your other trading environments. You then simply `source workspaces/CSI500_Base/run_env.sh` to start operating in it.
