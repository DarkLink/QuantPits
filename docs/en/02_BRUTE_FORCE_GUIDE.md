# Brute Force Ensemble Backtesting Guide

Automates the exhaustive combinatorial tracking of all model predictions, executing equal-weighted fusion backtests on each subset to uncover the optimal model ensemble pipeline.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd /path/to/QuantPits

# Quick test (max 3 models per combo, ~175 backtests)
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --max-combo-size 3

# Full exhaustive search (10 models = 1023 combos, highly time-intensive)
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py

# Analysis only (bypasses recalculating backtests)
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --analysis-only

# Resume from interruption (via Ctrl+C payload or fatal exit)
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --resume

# Exhaustive search utilizing Model Grouping (only selections one per group, slashes overhead)
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --use-groups

# Specific groupings + throttle logical cores to limit RAM pressure
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --use-groups --group-config config/my_groups.yaml --n-jobs 2
```

## Script Flow

### Stage 1 — Load Predictions
- Reads `latest_train_records.json` to acquire the experiment name and available model mapping.
- Spawns Qlib Recorders to load `pred.pkl` prediction scores for each active model.
- Conducts cross-sectional Z-Score normalization daily.

### Stage 2 — Correlation Analysis
- Evaluates prediction correlation matrices.
- Saves raw correlation CSVs for subsequent debugging.

### Stage 3 — Brute Force Backtesting
- Generates all valid combinatorial subset models (from 1 to N).
- For each subset combo: Equal-weight fusion → TopkDropoutStrategy → Native Qlib Simulation.
- Extracts core portfolio mechanics: Annualized Return, Max Drawdown, Calmar Ratio, Excess Return.
- Supports `--resume` to ingest existing CSV batches without restart logic.

### Stage 4 — Result Analysis
- **Top Combo Ranks**: Ordered by Annualized Excess Return (Top 20) and Calmar Robustness (Top 10).
- **Model Attribution**: Examines frequency footprints of models inhabiting the Top/Bottom N, constructing net-win distributions.
- **Correlation vs Performance**: Highlights diversity multipliers, seeking out low-correlation/high-Calmar "Golden Pipelines".
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Computes Ward linkage dendrograms utilizing Excess Return profiles.
- **Weight Optimization**: Comparative trials on Top 10 single models simulating Max Sharpe / Risk Parity optimization mappings.
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates autonomous summaries of MVP models and superior fusions.

> [!NOTE]
> **Understanding Metric Discrepancies: Single Models vs. Ensemble Backtests**
>
> When evaluating model performance within fusion and brute-force architectures, strict **Z-Score Normalization** and **Data Alignment** processing govern the engine. Therefore, because of TopK position bounding, backtest results of a single model here may exhibit reasonable, micro-level disparities from the raw metrics evaluated naturally post-training (e.g. via `run_analysis.py`):
> 1. **Isolated Normalization**: Each model calculates its daily cross-sectional Z-scores purely on its *own* non-null predicted universe. Scaling remains mathematically uniform, and a single model's signal scale cannot be skewed by other models' data coverage gaps prior to scoring.
> 2. **Delayed Intersection**: Strict intersection dropping (`dropna(how='any')`) is executed strictly at the exact combo scoring phase and is limited precisely to the subset of models within that specific combo iteration. This guarantees irrelevant sub-models don't unilaterally shrink the evaluated combination universe.
> 3. **Benchmarking Alignment**: The sub-model evaluation leaderboard dynamically slices historical records to match the precise temporal boundaries established by the current ensemble matrix index. This constructs a perfect "apples-to-apples" comparison avoiding overlapping timeframe distortion.

## Runtime Considerations

Assuming 10 active models (1023 sequential iterations):

| Range | Combos | ETA Scope |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1~3 | 175 | ~15 min |
| 1~5 | 637 | ~50 min |
| 1~10 (All) | 1023 | ~1.5 hours |

> **Best Practice**: Execute a preliminary `--max-combo-size 3` to test system integration before throwing heavy monolithic batches onto hardware.

## Advanced Usage

### Strict Combinatorial Sizes
```bash
# Evaluate only permutations featuring precisely 4 to 6 models
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --min-combo-size 4 --max-combo-size 6
```

### Daily Simulation Mapping
```bash
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --freq day
```

### High-Fidelity Deep Dive Analysis
```bash
# Top/Bottom 100 footprint attribution
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --analysis-only --top-n 100
```

## Checkpoint Sequencing & Safe Interruptions

The architecture bolsters **streaming checkpoints** alongside **Safe Interrupt protocols**, making volatile workloads secure from progression loss.

### Mechanics

- **Batch Chunking**: Global combinations are segmented into `--batch-size` partitions, aggressively persisting CSV logs at identical bounds.
- **Signal Tapping**: Interfaces attach to `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) / `SIGTERM` handlers. Triggering causes:
  1. Queued termination bounds across active batch nodes.
  2. Commits currently executed pipelines entirely to IO safely.
  3. Halts gracefully.
  4. Subsequent Ctrl+C forcibly ends memory mapping.
- **Resume Routing**: Engaging `--resume` parses the destination output and automatically nulls pre-completed combos.

### Execution Trace

```bash
# Initiate
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --max-combo-size 5

# Ctrl+C applied here -> Wait for current thread sync, outputs termination prompt
# "⚠️ Interrupted safely! Completed: X/Y combos. Utilize --resume next session."

# Step 1: Train targeted algorithms
python quantpits/scripts/static_train.py --full
 --max-combo-size 5 --resume
```

### RAM Safeguards

| Parameter | Purpose |
|------|------|
| `--batch-size` | Dial down interval ranges to mitigate peak process retention (Default 50). |
| `--n-jobs` | Reduce thread spawns to alleviate simultaneous mapping loads (2-4 suggested). |

> Hard allocations are managed implicitly utilizing aggressive `gc.collect()` invokes immediately following each batch horizon.

## Model Grouping Exhaustion

Scaling beyond 15+ algorithms inherently dictates explosive permutation mapping magnitudes (32767+ combinations). Grouped exhaustion categorizes individual algorithms into distinct mutually-exclusive vectors, strictly imposing structural rules to pick a ceiling of 1 mapping per bounded group, significantly culling permutations.

### Configuration Layout

Group domains are sourced at `config/combo_groups.yaml`:

```yaml
groups:
  LSTM_variants:           # Nominal ID string
    - lstm_Alpha360        # Internal targeting index (Aligns to train_records hash values)
    - alstm_Alpha158
    - alstm_Alpha360

  Tree_models:
    - lightgbm_Alpha158
    - catboost_Alpha158

  # ... Additional grouping matrices ...
```

**Constraints**:
- IDs strictly provide cosmetic rendering boundaries.
- When toggling constrained groups, **unmapped models are natively suppressed** (skipped).
- Operates totally disparately from tags injected via `model_registry.yaml`.
- `--min/max-combo-size` scopes re-orient to bound the logic toward **quantities of active group containers invoked**.

### Execution

```bash
# Toggle utilizing default group constraints
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --use-groups

# Pass alternate YAML group routing definitions
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --use-groups --group-config config/custom_groups.yaml

# Filter combinatorial lengths utilizing bounded sizes across group capacities
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_ensemble.py --use-groups --min-combo-size 3 --max-combo-size 4
```

### Output Reductions

| Scale | Volume Baseline | Exhaustive Combos | Grouped Combos |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 15 Models, 6 groups × 2~3 nodes | 15 | 32767 | ~500 |
| 10 Models, 5 groups × 2 nodes | 10 | 1023 | ~62 |

> **Notice**: The vectorized fast port (`brute_force_fast.py`) is intrinsically tied to parity regarding `--use-groups` and `--group-config` overrides.

## ⚡ Accelerated Vectors (`brute_force_fast.py`)

Processing matrices expanding above a 10+ node density yield unacceptable wait loops executing natively on Qlib. `brute_force_fast.py` overrides the simulation core by utilizing **NumPy/CuPy vectorized matrix calculation methodologies**. It yields a **~5000x acceleration multiplier**.

### Quick Setup

```bash
cd /path/to/QuantPits

# Test sample
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py --max-combo-size 3

# Unrestricted combinations
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py

# ================================
# Premium Mitigation: Out-Of-Sample Chronology Splits
# Isolates combinations via purely In-Sample windows filtering the most recent year.
# Verifies dynamically selected Top 10 ensembles on the completely blind forward step.
# ================================
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py --exclude-last-years 1 --auto-test-top 10

# Push compute layer to GPU architectures
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py --use-gpu

# Local Analysis
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py --analysis-only

# Crash recovery
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py --resume

# Filter using Group limits targeting faster subset scaling
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py --use-groups --group-config config/combo_groups_20.yaml
```

### Deviations Across Simulations

| Layer | Standard (Qlib Backend) | Vectorized Fast |
|------|:---:|:---:|
| Limit Up/Down Discards | ✅ | ❌ |
| Trade Costing Assumptions | ✅ Precision Check | ⚠️ Proxied via Aggregate Turnover Rates |
| TopK+Dropout Mechanics | ✅ Implemented | ⚠️ Simplified TopK only |
| Cash Reinvestment Logic | ✅ Dynamic Volume | ❌ Pure equal-balance assumptions |
| Time Constraint | ~5s/combo | ~0.001s/combo |

> **Note on Precision Deviations**: There are significant discrepancies between the fast version and the formal exhaustive search (since the fast version cannot smoothly handle positional states, leading to substantial errors for transactions that do not involve full-position swaps). Please use with caution.

### Optimized Workflow Progression

1.  **Broad Net**: Engage `python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py` scaling all exhaustive combinations (Completes rapidly).
2.  **Precision Audit**: Extract top 10/20 groupings from the prior log, pushing them specifically against `brute_force_ensemble.py` ensuring deep realistic metrics.
3.  **Execution Delivery**: Cement the validated combination scope into `ensemble_fusion.py` driving trading signal distribution.

### Dedicated Fast Arguments

| Argument | Built-In | Core Intent |
|------|--------|------|
| `--batch-size` | `512` | Massive vector matrix chunking sizes across array layers. |
| `--use-gpu` | - | Routes memory allocation to CuPy drivers scaling hardware acceleration. |
| `--no-gpu` | - | Forces host device array calculations. |
| `--cost-rate` | `0.002` | Friction proxies tied to turnover deviations mapping bidirectional 0.2%. |

> Auxiliary bounds (`--max-combo-size`, `--resume`, `--analysis-only`, `--use-groups`, `--group-config`, `--exclude-last-years`, `--auto-test-top` etc.) translate perfectly over from standard topologies.

## 🕰️ Hardened Paradigms: Preventing In-Sample Overfitting

While brute-forcing, programmatic optimization guarantees immense susceptibility against **In-Sample Overfitting** (Forming subsets identically geared exclusively toward the simulation period logic, crumbling upon forward deployment instances).

By employing `brute_force_ensemble.py` and `brute_force_fast.py` coupled with **Dynamic Relative Time Fencing**, the architecture quarantines forward temporal data retaining it as an explicit **Out-Of-Sample (OOS) Baseline Evaluator**:

### Validated Chronology Filtering

```bash
# 1. Search subsets generating outputs immediately scored on chronological OOS blind data.
# --exclude-last-years 1: Fences the latest year entirely outside algorithm views processing 2-year prior spans as base.
# --auto-test-top 5: Forces subsequent backtests against the blind year dynamically scoring robustness.
python quantpits/scripts/brute_force_fast.py --exclude-last-years 1 --auto-test-top 5
```

Deploying traces will output standardized bounds appending a `Stage 5: Autonomous Out-Of-Sample (OOS) Testing Scope (Top 5)` log verifying forward reality mappings.

### Date Modifiers

| Overrides | Contextual Range |
|------|------|
| `--exclude-last-years N` | Quarantines most recent chronological N years establishing dynamic IS boundaries prioritizing blind testing sets. |
| `--exclude-last-months N` | Replicates utilizing discrete month bounds. |
| `--auto-test-top N` | Isolates Top N algorithms testing them aggressively against forward data dumping `oos_validation_{date}.csv`.|
| `--start-date YYYY-MM-DD` | Absolute forced start. |
| `--end-date YYYY-MM-DD` | Subversive forced stop bounds deleting all subsequent rows. |

> Warning: Trading data is continually rolled per schedule natively. Implementing dynamic `exclude-last-years` / `exclude-last-months` fences inherently aligns testing without needing static arbitrary data edits per epoch.
> Note: Since prediction data rolls over time (added according to frequency), it is recommended to use `exclude-last-years` or `exclude-last-months` to dynamically keep the latest samples stripped, avoiding manual modification of absolute dates.

```bash
# CUDA 12.x Install Path
pip install cupy-cuda11x # or cupy-cuda12x, depending on your CUDA version

# CUDA 11.x Install Path
pip install cupy-cuda11x
```

### Fast-Mode Benchmark Times

| Range Node Limits | Output Pool | Core CPU Path | CuPy GPU Execution Path |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1~3 | 175 | ~2s | ~1s |
| 1~5 | 637 | ~5s | ~2s |
| 1~10 (Full) | 1023 | ~10s | ~3s |
| 1~15 (Insane) | 32767 | ~5 min | ~1 min |
